## 📂 NER_SciSpacy

### 📌 Overview

The `NER_SciSpacy` directory contains an advanced Named Entity Recognition (NER) project specifically designed for biomedical and clinical texts. It leverages SciSpacy, particularly the powerful biomedical model `en_ner_bc5cdr_md`, achieving high precision, recall, and overall strong F1 scores in recognizing diseases and chemical entities.

### 🌟 Highlights

- Utilizes specialized biomedical models from the [SciSpacy collection](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/).
- Implements dependency parsing in conjunction with NER for detailed entity-relationship extraction.
- Employs abbreviation detection and resolution to enhance clarity and accuracy of identified entities.
- Integrates the UMLS Entity Linker for robust semantic interpretation of clinical terms.

### 🛠️ Implementation

The detailed implementation is available as a Jupyter notebook within the [`NER_SciSpacy`](NER_SciSpacy/) directory.

## 📂 Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment

### 📌 Overview

The `Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment` directory demonstrates a comprehensive sentiment analysis pipeline applied to movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. This project harnesses modern transformer models along with meticulous data preprocessing, cleaning, and language detection methods to accurately determine sentiment polarity.

### 🌟 Highlights

- Applies state-of-the-art transformer architectures for effective sentiment classification.
- Incorporates robust language detection ensuring quality and consistency of the input data.
- Delivers reliable and interpretable sentiment analysis results.

### 🛠️ Implementation

Comprehensive preprocessing and model training steps can be found in the Jupyter notebook provided within the [`Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment`](Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment/) directory.
