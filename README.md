NLP Projects Repository

This repository contains two distinct NLP projects, each housed within their respective directories:

NER_SciSpacy

Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment

1. NER_SciSpacy

Overview

The NER_SciSpacy directory demonstrates advanced Named Entity Recognition (NER) tailored specifically for biomedical and clinical texts. Utilizing SciSpacy's highly specialized biomedical models, the project achieves high precision and recall (F1 scores), particularly with the en_ner_bc5cdr_md model, known for its robust performance in identifying diseases and chemical entities.

Highlights

Utilizes SciSpacy library and models from the SciSpacy collection.

Implements dependency parsing on top of NER to extract meaningful entity relationships from clinical texts.

Includes abbreviation detection and resolution for clearer and more precise entity identification.

Employs the UMLS Entity Linker for deeper semantic understanding, enhancing clinical entity recognition accuracy.

Code

Find the comprehensive Jupyter notebook for detailed implementation in the NER_SciSpacy directory.

2. Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment

Overview

The Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment directory showcases sentiment analysis on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews, leveraging modern transformer architectures. The project emphasizes thorough data preprocessing, including robust data cleaning techniques and language detection to enhance model performance and accuracy.

Highlights

Applies state-of-the-art transformer models for sentiment classification.

Demonstrates detailed preprocessing steps including removal of noise, irrelevant data, and language filtering.

Incorporates language detection methods to ensure the input corpus' integrity.

Achieves reliable performance metrics suitable for analyzing sentiment polarity accurately.

Code

Detailed preprocessing and model-training steps can be reviewed in the provided Jupyter notebook within the Rotten_Tomatos_Sentiment directory.
